# Geant4JetTiming2014
This is a commit of the code used in Winter 2014 to study time-based jet vertexing using GEANT4 and the "Bacon" analysis framework. To be run on t3-higgs or lxplus using CMSSW_5_3_9.  

Note that this code is NOT meant to work out of the box and will probably require a lot of tinkering if you want to use it.  At minimum you will need to copy some packages from Si's lxplus area:
